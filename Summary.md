This project was built to meet the requirements of the Social Media Content Analyzer technical assessment by focusing on clean architecture, practical functionality, and a polished user experience. I implemented the application using React + Vite for fast development, Tailwind CSS for styling, and a modular component structure to keep the code production-ready and maintainable.
File uploading supports both drag-and-drop and a manual browse option through react-dropzone. Text extraction is performed in two ways: PDF parsing using pdfjs-dist and OCR for images using Tesseract.js. To maintain readable formatting, extracted PDF text is grouped based on Y-coordinates, preserving natural line breaks. For images, OCR progress is displayed in real-time to improve user clarity.
After extraction, the application performs lightweight social-media-focused analysis, including word count, hashtag/mention detection, emoji usage, and engagement suggestions. Users can download a full analysis report, making the tool practical for content review.
A light/dark theme toggle is included to improve accessibility and UX. Error handling, file size limits, disabled UI states, and loading indicators ensure a smooth experience. Overall, the solution focuses on clear structure, free/open-source technologies, and user-friendly design.
